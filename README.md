# Tower Defense Game (Python + Pygame)

This is a **Tower Defense game** written in Python using the **Pygame** library. It was developed as part of lab exercises for a university course.

## About the Project
In this game, the player defends their base by strategically placing and upgrading turrets on a map. Waves of enemies follow a path to reach the base. The player loses health when enemies get through and earns money by defeating them. The game includes both an **Endless Mode** and a **Plot Mode** with story-based progression and objectives.

## Features

### üéÆ Core Gameplay
- **Turret System**: Multiple turret types with upgrade levels.
- **Enemy Types**: Normal, Heavy, Fast, and Boss enemies with distinct stats.
- **Map System**: Tile-based maps with different terrain types affecting movement.
- **Pathfinding**: Enemies use A* algorithm to navigate to the base.
- **Story Progression**: In Plot Mode, players receive mission pop-ups and objectives.
- **Logger**: Game actions are logged and can be toggled on/off in-game.
- **Keyboard + Mouse Controls**: Supports both cursor and key-based turret placement.

### üíæ Save/Load & History System
- **Game Progress Persistence**:
  - Saves level, turrets, money, HP, wave count, and enemy configuration.
  - Saves automatically after each completed wave.
- **Supports 3 Save Formats**:
  - JSON
  - XML
  - MongoDB (NoSQL)
- **Game Resume**:
  - Resume from last saved progress including turret placements and enemy state.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Dialog (Tkinter)
- Launches at start of game.
- Allows selection of:
  - **Player Mode**: Single Player / Local 2 Player / Network Game
  - **IP and Port**: With validation and placeholders.
- Configuration is saved together with game history in selected save format.

### `Map`
- Loads maps from files.
- Manages tile grid, enemy spawns, and level state.

### `Tile`
- Represents individual tiles (e.g. path, grass, mountain).
- Contains movement cost for pathfinding.

### `Enemy`
- Handles movement, pathfinding (A*), health, and death.
- Uses `ENEMY_DATA` to load enemies properties.

### `Turret`
- Manages targeting, rotation, firing, upgrades, and visuals.
- Uses `TURRET_DATA` to load turret properties.

### `Button`
- GUI button class for the main menu and in-game UI.

### `StoryManager`
- Shows plot popups with mission briefings.

### `MissionManager`
- Tracks player objectives (e.g. upgrade a turret) and gives rewards.

### `GameLogger`
- Logs key events to file and optionally displays them in-game.

### `ConfigDialog`
- Tkinter-based UI dialog for configuring game mode and network options.

### `JSONSaveManager` / `XMLSaveManager`
- Manages saving and loading game state to/from `.json` and `.xml` files.

### `MongoDBSaveManager`
- Connects to local MongoDB instance.
- Saves and loads game progress from a MongoDB collection.

## Author & Notes
Created as a lab assignment project.
The codebase is modular and designed for easy extension (new levels, turrets, enemies, etc.).
Save system supports real-world serialization practices with JSON, XML, and MongoDB.
